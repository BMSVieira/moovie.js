00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.000
- Jyn, whatever I do,

2
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.020
I do it to protect you.

3
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.900
Say you understand.

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.720
- I understand.

5
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.440
- You want to get out of here?

6
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.480
- Our rebellion is all that remains to push back the Empire.

7
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.200
You think you might be able to help us?

8
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.820
- When was the last time you were in contact with your father?

9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.960
- What is this?

10
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.700
- It appears he's critical to the development of a super weapon.

11
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.880
- If my father built this thing,

12
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.420
we need to find him.

13
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.700
- Alright,

14
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.980
how many do we need?

15
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.580
- They are requesting a call sign

16
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.620
- It's um...

17
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.180
Rogue.

18
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.540
Rogue One.

19
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.920
- The power that we are dealing with here

20
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.720
is immeasurable.

21
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.680
- If the Empire has this kind of power

22
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.320
what chance do we have?

23
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.500
- We have hope.

24
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.420
Rebellions are built on hope!

25
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.600
- They've no idea we're coming.

26
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.480
- Take hold of this moment

27
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.320
The force is strong.

28
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.900
- Make ten men feel like a hundred.

29
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.740
- We'll take the next chance,

30
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.700
and the next,

31
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.980
you're all rebels, aren't you?

32
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.880
- Save the rebellion!

33
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.580
Save the Dream!
